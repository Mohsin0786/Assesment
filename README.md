# `About assesment`

In this I have used fetch for getting the data from the API and storing it using Usestate

I have used the spinner which will triggered untill data is fetched once data is fetched it becomes dissapear
I have handled this event using state where at initial state value is false for spinner and state for data holding is null
once button is clicked spinner state becomes true and we see spinner on screen untill the data is fetched once it is fetched the spinner state becomes false and data get hold by 
data state and we can now see all the cards
